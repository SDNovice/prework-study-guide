# SD Prework Guide to Studying

## Description

This is a website that is designed to help not only me, but other prospecting coders to have a reference to some of the basics of coding. When people first start learning how to code it can be overwhelming. Different terms are thrown at an individual at high volumes and even the most specific details matter. My website was designed to be a point of reference. The four languages included are: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Each language has its own card and set of information that correlates to each language. As I developed each card I went and added more information to each previous card. I became more familiar with git commands each time I did, as well as started to gain clarifications over the terminology that came with working with local and cloud data. I got a more in depth understanding with the structure of html and how to link CSS and JavaScript into the head of HTML furthering my understanding on how they all correlate. I wish to share this same knowledge via this project.

In order to interact with my website, all you need to do is use Chrome DevTools to access the console. To do this, you can either right click on the site and select "inspect" or "inspect elements" depending on which OS you are using. You can also use keyboard shortcuts to access the console as well. If using macOS press 'Command+Option+I' if using Windows press 'Control+Shift+I'. Once in the console you will be able to see the topics listed, and to select which one to study simply refresh the page and the console will state which topic to study.
