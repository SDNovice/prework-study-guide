        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML structure is comprised from multiple elements - Text, Image, Headers, etc ...</li>
          <li>Before the Head the document type is defined using {!DOCTYPE html} as well as the language (lang="en").</li>
          <li>The head element contains information (metadata) about the webpage.</li>
          <li>HTML metadata can be the - charset (usually UTF-8), the title, and style sheets or links to style sheets.</li>
          <li>In semantic HTML elements (like the {body} element), the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to a user.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements.</li>
          <li>The element that holds all the children is known as the parent element.</li>
          <li>The {h1} through {h6} elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
          <li>The {p} element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The {ul}, {ol}, and {li} elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
          <li>The {br} element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>The src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
          <li>The {a} element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
          <li>An internal style sheet is when the entire stylesheet is embed directly in the HTML file using a {style} element in the {head} element.</li>
          <li>External Style sheets use the {link} element and is place int the HTML's {head}.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>CSS Rule indicates a selector and a declarartion block (which contains properties their values.</li>
          <li>To target specified elements a class selector (which are defined in HTML) are used.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>We declare a variable using the 'var' keyword and '=' as an assignment operator.</li>
          <li>'console.log' method is use to output a message to the web console by adding an argument.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed.</li>
          <li>When using the 'if' statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
          <li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result.</li>
          <li>A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: [0], [-0], [On], [""], [null], [undefined], [NaN], or [false].</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
          <li>The first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1. The indices, or location identifiers, will always be whole numbers that increase by 1 each time.</li>
          <li>A 'for' loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>To create a function, we use the 'function keyword', similar to how we used the 'var' keyword to declare a new variable.</li>
          <li>In order for a function to be used in pur code we must call it in our program.</li>
